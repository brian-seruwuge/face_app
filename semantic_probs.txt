issues faced in facebook project
failed to load semantic-ui
solution
1. npm install --save semantic-ui-react
2. npm install --save semantic-ui-css      (The second dependancy will allow you to apply styles)
3. import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';    (as well in the components you are working on)


postgres and node js
cannot read property query is not defined            - error occured as pool had not been exported in server.js ie add module.exports = { pool }

pool is not defined 
occured as server.js or pool had not been imported into index.js                      -const { pool } = require('./db/server')

cannot find module index.js// resolveFilename-   occured because i had changed file names from original

module not found --- occured because app.route('/users') and app.get(getUsers) had not been added
